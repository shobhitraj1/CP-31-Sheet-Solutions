// Have to find the largest consecutive sequence of numbers such that all of them are factors of n
// If n%kâ‰ 0, then max. size < k --> because every sequence of size k will have atleast one number
// divisible by k, & if that number in the sequence divides n, then k|n which contradicts
// Hence, start checking from 2,3,4,...
