## 📂 Structure
The repository is organized by difficulty level. Each folder corresponds to a specific difficulty:
- **800/**, **900/**, **1000/**, ... : Contain `.cpp` files for problems at that difficulty level.
Inside each folder:
- Each `.cpp` file is named after the problem number and title (e.g., `1000-1-Problem Name.cpp`).
- The top of each `.cpp` file includes:
  - A link to the problem statement.
  - A brief explanation of the approach and logic used to solve the problem.
  - The code solution.
