# CP-31-Sheet-Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to problems from the **CP31 sheet** by TLE Eliminators, which features problem ranging from 800 to 1600 in difficulty on Codeforces.

## 📝 Overview
- **CP Sheet**: [CP31 Sheet](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet)

## 📂 Structure
The repository is organized by difficulty level. Each folder corresponds to a specific difficulty:
- **800/**, **900/**, **1000/**, ... : Contain `.cpp` files for problems at that difficulty level.
Inside each folder:
- Each `.cpp` file is named after the problem number and title (e.g., `1000-1-Problem Name.cpp`).
- The top of each `.cpp` file includes:
  - A link to the problem statement.
  - A brief explanation of the approach and logic used to solve the problem.
  - The code solution.
